This is an example of how to peform 50 differential evolution runs of 
every test function in the global optimization test suite for population 
sizes from 10 to 1000. Every run performs 75000 function evaluations. 

This takes very very very long on one computer, but becomes manageable 
with a cluster of 20 CPUs. 

Every run is a batch job. Batch jobs are scheduled asynchronously to CPUs 
in the cluster. The results are stored in files (around 50G). The fhist* 
files contain the pickled function evaluation history for one run. 

The an.py example shows how to load the results and analyze them. 

The actual job (callable object) must be defined in a separate module so 
that it can be pickled and sent to remote tasks. 


To run the example under MPI, edit the hosts file (hosts.openmpi) and type 
  
  mpirun -n 100 -hostfile hosts.openmpi python depop.py

The above example is for a cluster with 100 CPUs 
(e.g. 25 quad core machines). 

To see the results edit the an.py file (set function index, population size, 
and run index) and type

  python an.py
