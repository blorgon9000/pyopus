This is a tutorial on the usage of the PVM interface. 

Study it in the order in which the files are numbered. 

Before you run the examples, edit the hosts.pvm file and change the
username, home directory, path to the python interpreter, and host list.
Then start the pvm system by typing

  pvm hosts.pvm

Now you can run the examples. To run the first example type: 

  python 01-config.py

To shut down the pvm system, enter the pvm console by typing 

  pvm

and enter

  halt
