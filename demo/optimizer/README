This folder shows you how to use various optimizers. 

Some more complex exampels have their own subfolders. 

The order in which you study these examples is not important. 

Some examples (psade.py and de.py) demonstrate parallel algorithms 
in a parallel environment (MPI). To run them with parallel 
processing enabled, type

mpirun -n <number of processes> python <example>.py

To run the problems across multiple machines the set of hosts must 
be defined in hosts.openmpi. Tu run an example, type 

mpirun -hostfile hosts.openmpi -n <number of processes> python <example>.py
