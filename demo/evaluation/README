This is a tutorial that teaches you how to use simulator interface objects and 
how to create performance evaluation chains from a PerformanceEvaluator object 
to the CostEvaluator object. It also shows how one uses various Optimizers 
(local and parallel) and how the performance evaluation results can be 
visualized before, during, and after optimization. 

Study the examples starting with the folder numbered 01.
